# Comments System Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Database Schema Issues**:
   - Added the `comment_type` field to the Comment model (migration 0008_add_comment_type.py)
   - Added the `is_edited` field to the Comment model (migration 0009_add_is_edited_field.py)
   - Created the CommentReaction table (migration 0011_create_commentreaction_table.py)

2. **Serializer Issues**:
   - Updated the CommentSerializer to use `first_name` and `last_name` instead of `username`
   - Fixed the avatar handling to use `avatar_base64` instead of `avatar.url`
   - Added explicit SerializerMethodFields for `likes_count` and `dislikes_count`

3. **Model-Database Mismatch**:
   - Changed the `likes_count` property to a field with a default value of 0
   - Added a method to update the `likes_count` field when reactions are added or removed

4. **API Endpoint Issues**:
   - Updated the CommentViewSet's `perform_update` method to include the lesson field
   - Updated the CommentReactionViewSet to update the likes_count when reactions are added or removed

5. **Frontend Issues**:
   - Updated the frontend code to include the lesson ID when adding comments and replies

## How to Test

Run the test script to verify that all operations are working correctly:

```bash
python test_comments_api.py
```

This script tests:
- Getting comments for a lesson
- Creating a new comment
- Updating a comment
- Deleting a comment

## Remaining Tasks

1. Update the frontend code to include the lesson ID when adding comments and replies:
   - In the `addComment` method, add `lesson: parseInt(lessonId.value)` to the POST data
   - In the `submitReply` method, add `lesson: parseInt(lessonId.value)` to the POST data

2. Verify that the comments system works correctly in the frontend application.
